<h1><b>Store Sales Prediction</b></h1><p>

This repository contains the code for a store sales prediction model. The model is built using machine learning algorithms and it predicts the sales of a store based on various factors such as the store location, store type, and department.

<b>Getting Started</b><br>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

<b>Prerequisites</b><br>
You will need to install the following libraries to run the code:<br>

numpy<br>
pandas<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
scikit-learn<br>

You can install these libraries using the following command:<br>

<li>pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn</li> <p>

<b>Running the Code</b><br>
To run the code, simply clone this repository and navigate to the Store-Sales-Prediction directory. Then, run the following command:

<li>python main.py</li><br>

The code will then load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions. The results will be displayed in the form of a graph.
